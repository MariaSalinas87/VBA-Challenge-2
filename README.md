Stocks Research

Stece asked me to help him research a few years of stocks, to help his parents pick the best stocks to invest in. To do so I had to refactor the worksheet I had already submitted to Steve.

There were some edits that needed to be done to the program in order to make it work more efficiently.

As you can see in this screenshot, you can see that it took the program .070 seconds to run for the year 2017, as opposed to .496 in the previous code.


In this chart below, you will find that chart for the year 2018 and it took .070 as opposed to .484 in the previous written code.

According to my research, refactoring the code makes the program run faster and more efficient. In less amount of time, I was able to get the results for Steve.
